Repository for work related to my MSc Dissertation in Urban Spatial Science on Employment Modelling.

A number of different datasets exceed GitHub size limits and have correspondingly not been uploaded to GitHub. Most notably, raw data and machine learning results will not be visible, but all scripts are avaliable here.

Note that this is a v2 of my Dissertation Repository. My first repository was a bit of a sandbox and became unusably cluttered as a result.
